RoboRIO imaging:

C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2016\project\roboRIO Tool and double click on roboRIO_ImagingTool.exe
This may fail on the first try.

Then, go to http://roborio-2239-frc.local/ in order to connect to the RoboRio (You must use Internet Explorer, not Microsoft Edge)

Check to make sure the PDP has the correct firmware version matching with the version on
http://www.ctr-electronics.com/pdp.html#product_tabs_technical_resources

Change the device ID on the PDP to 1. It needs a different device ID than the PCM in order to be able to communicate with the PCM.

Click "save". Make sure the device ID stays at 1.

Refresh the page and make sure the PCM shows up this time.

Now check the Firmware on the PCM (same website, just different component)

Now, install Java on the RoboRIO: C:\Users\hopki\wpilib\tools\java-installer.jar
